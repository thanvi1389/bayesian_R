# bayesian_R
Assessed robustness of longitudinal cognitive models to missing Age data (Age02â€“Age05) by performing mean imputation. Re-estimated two Bayesian models (random intercept &amp; slope, and quadratic time) using the imputed dataset to evaluate sensitivity of TICS score trajectories in centenarian offspring vs controls.
